/// A pipe for processing block details using a defined processor.
///
/// The `BlockDetailsPipe` processes updates related to block metadata, such as
/// slot, block hash, and rewards. It uses a `Processor` to handle the block
/// details and perform the necessary operations.
///
/// ## Fields
///
/// - `processor`: A `Processor` that processes block details updates.
/// - `filters`: A collection of filters that determine which block details
///   updates should be processed. Each filter in this collection is applied to
///   incoming block details updates, and only updates that pass all filters
///   (return `true`) will be processed. If this collection is empty, all
///   updates are processed.

/// An async trait for processing block details.
///
/// The `BlockDetailsPipes` trait allows for processing of block details.
///
/// # Required Methods
///
/// - `run`: Processes a block details event and tracks the operation with
///   metrics.
/// - `filters`: Returns a reference to the filters associated with this pipe,
///   which are used by the pipeline to determine which block details events
///   should be processed.
