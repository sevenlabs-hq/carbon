//! Provides structures and traits for processing and decoding Solana accounts
//! within the pipeline.
//!
//! This module includes the necessary components for handling account data
//! updates in the `carbon-core` pipeline. It provides abstractions for decoding
//! accounts, processing account metadata, and implementing account-specific
//! pipes, which are integral to the pipeline's account update processing.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! The `account` module supports various tasks related to Solana account
//! processing:
//! - **Account Metadata**: Metadata about accounts, including slot and public
//!   key information.
//! - **Decoded Account**: Holds detailed account data after decoding, such as
//!   lamports, owner, and rent epoch.
//! - **Account Decoders**: A trait-based mechanism to decode raw Solana account
//!   data into structured formats for processing.
//! - **Account Pipes**: Encapsulates account processing logic, allowing custom
//!   processing of decoded account data in the pipeline.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```ignore
//! struct MyAccountDecoder;
//!
//! impl<'a> AccountDecoder<'a> for MyAccountDecoder {
//!     type AccountType = (AccountMetadata, DecodedAccount<PumpAccount>);
//!
//!     fn decode_account(
//!         &self,
//!         account: &'a solana_account::Account,
//!     ) -> Option<DecodedAccount<Self::AccountType>> {
//!         // Custom decoding logic here
//!         Some(DecodedAccount {
//!             lamports: account.lamports,
//!             data: String::from_utf8(account.data.clone()).ok()?,
//!             owner: account.owner,
//!             executable: account.executable,
//!             rent_epoch: account.rent_epoch,
//!         })
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Notes
//!
//! - This module requires access to Solana SDK structures, specifically
//!   `Account` and `Pubkey`.
//! - All components support asynchronous processing to enable concurrent data
//!   handling in the pipeline.

/// `AccountMetadata` provides essential information about an account update,

/// public key. This metadata is used within the pipeline to identify and
/// process account updates.
///
/// # Fields
///
/// - `slot`: The Solana slot number where the account was updated.
/// - `pubkey`: The public key of the account.
/// - `transaction_signature`: Signature of the transaction that caused the update.

///
/// `DecodedAccount` holds the detailed data of a Solana account after it has
/// been decoded. It includes the account's lamports, owner, executable status,
/// and rent epoch, as well as any decoded data specific to the account.
///
/// # Type Parameters
///
/// - `T`: The type of data specific to the account, which is determined by the

///
/// # Fields
///
/// - `lamports`: The number of lamports in the account.
/// - `data`: The decoded data specific to the account.

/// - `executable`: Whether the account is executable.
/// - `rent_epoch`: The rent epoch of the account.

/// - `filters`: A collection of filters that determine which account updates
///   should be processed. Each filter in this collection is applied to incoming
///   account updates, and only updates that pass all filters (return `true`)
///   will be processed. If this collection is empty, all updates are processed.
