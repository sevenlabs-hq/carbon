//! Provides traits and structures for managing and consuming data updates from
//! various sources.
//!
//! The `datasource` module defines the `Datasource` trait and associated data
//! types for handling updates related to accounts, transactions, and account
//! deletions. This module allows for flexible data ingestion from various
//! Solana data sources, enabling integration with the `carbon-core` processing
//! pipeline.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! The core component of this module is the `Datasource` trait, which
//! represents an interface for consuming data updates asynchronously.
//! Implementations of `Datasource` provide the logic for fetching data updates
//! and delivering them via a channel to the pipeline. Different types of
//! updates are represented by the `Update` enum, including:
//! - `AccountUpdate`: Represents updates to accounts, including the account's
//!   public key, slot, and other account data.
//! - `TransactionUpdate`: Represents transaction updates, including transaction
//!   details, signature, and status metadata.
//! - `AccountDeletion`: Represents account deletion events, indicating when an
//!   account is removed from the blockchain state.
//!
//! The module also includes the `UpdateType` enum to categorize the kinds of
//! updates that a data source can provide.
//!
//! # Notes
//!
//! - The `Datasource` trait is asynchronous and should be used within a Tokio
//!   runtime.
//! - Use the `Update` enum to encapsulate data updates of different types. This
//!   helps centralize handling of all update kinds in the pipeline.
//! - Ensure implementations handle errors gracefully, especially when fetching
//!   data and sending updates to the pipeline.

/// Defines the interface for data sources that produce updates for accounts,
/// transactions, and account deletions.
///
/// The `Datasource` trait represents a data source that can be consumed
/// asynchronously within a pipeline. Implementations of this trait are
/// responsible for fetching updates and sending them through a channel to be
/// processed further. Each datasource specifies the types of updates it
/// supports by implementing the `update_types` method.
///
/// # Required Methods
///
/// - `consume`: Initiates the asynchronous consumption of updates. This method
///   should send updates through the provided `sender` channel.
/// - `update_types`: Returns a list of `UpdateType` variants indicating the
///   types of updates the datasource can provide.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// use std::sync::Arc;
/// use carbon_core::datasource::UpdateType;
/// use carbon_core::datasource::Update;
/// use carbon_core::error::CarbonResult;
/// use carbon_core::metrics::MetricsCollection;
/// use carbon_core::datasource::Datasource;
/// use tokio_util::sync::CancellationToken;
/// use async_trait::async_trait;
/// 
/// #[async_trait]
/// impl Datasource for MyDatasource {
///     async fn consume(
///         &self,
///         sender: &tokio::sync::mpsc::UnboundedSender<Update>,
///         cancellation_token: CancellationToken,
///         metrics: Arc<MetricsCollection>,
///     ) -> CarbonResult<tokio::task::AbortHandle> {
///         // Implement update fetching logic
///     }
///
///     fn update_types(&self) -> Vec<UpdateType> {
///         vec![UpdateType::AccountUpdate, UpdateType::Transaction]
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Notes
///
/// - This trait is marked with `async_trait`, so implementations must be
///   asynchronous.
/// - The `consume` method should handle errors and retries to ensure robust
///   update delivery.
