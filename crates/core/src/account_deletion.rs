//! Provides structures and traits for handling account deletion events within
//! the pipeline.
//!
//! This module defines the `AccountDeletionPipe` struct and
//! `AccountDeletionPipes` trait, which allow for the processing of account
//! deletion events as they occur in the pipeline. By implementing
//! `AccountDeletionPipes`, you can create custom behavior for managing
//! the deletion of accounts and associated resources, integrating with metrics
//! for monitoring.

/// A processing pipe for handling account deletions.
///
/// The `AccountDeletionPipe` struct encapsulates the logic needed to process
/// account deletion events within the pipeline. It uses a `Processor` to define
/// how account deletions are managed, allowing for customizable handling based
/// on the needs of the application.
///
/// ## Functionality
///
/// This struct processes an `AccountDeletion` event by passing it through a
/// user-defined `Processor`. The processor is responsible for managing the
/// specific logic of the account deletion event, such as cleaning up resources
/// or updating other parts of the system. The `AccountDeletionPipe` also
/// integrates with `Metrics`, enabling the tracking and monitoring of deletion
/// events.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// use carbon_core::error::CarbonResult;
/// use carbon_core::metrics::MetricsCollection;
/// use carbon_core::datasource::AccountDeletion;
/// use carbon_core::processor::Processor;
/// use async_trait::async_trait;
/// use std::sync::Arc;
/// 
/// struct MyAccountDeletionProcessor;
///
/// #[async_trait]
/// impl Processor for MyAccountDeletionProcessor {
///     async fn process(
///         &self,
///         account_deletion: AccountDeletion,
///         metrics: Arc<MetricsCollection>,
///     ) -> CarbonResult<()> {
///         // Custom deletion logic
///         Ok(())
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Fields
///
/// - `processor`: A boxed `Processor` that handles the specific logic of
///   processing an account deletion event.
///
/// # Notes
///
/// - Ensure that the `Processor` implementation provided is designed to handle
///   account deletions.
/// - This struct is typically used within the broader pipeline structure for
///   managing updates.
pub struct AccountDeletionPipe {
    pub processor: Box<dyn Processor<InputType = AccountDeletion> + Send + Sync>,
}

/// A trait for handling account deletion events in the pipeline.
///
/// The `AccountDeletionPipes` trait defines an asynchronous `run` method, which
/// is responsible for processing an `AccountDeletion` event. Implementing this
/// trait allows you to create custom account deletion handling within the
/// pipeline, which can be extended to include metrics tracking or other
/// custom behaviors.
///
/// ## Functionality
///
/// The `run` method takes an `AccountDeletion` event and a list of `Metrics` to
/// track the processing operation. The method is asynchronous, allowing for
/// non-blocking operations, and is expected to return a `CarbonResult<()>`,
/// which indicates success or failure.
///
/// # Syntax
///
/// Implementations of `AccountDeletionPipes` should focus on handling account
/// deletions and integrating with metrics as needed.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// use carbon_core::metrics::MetricsCollection;
/// use std::sync::Arc;
/// use carbon_core::error::CarbonResult;
/// use carbon_core::datasource::AccountDeletion;
/// use carbon_core::account_deletion::AccountDeletionPipe;
/// use async_trait::async_trait;
/// 
/// struct MyAccountDeletionPipe;
///
/// #[async_trait]
/// impl AccountDeletionPipes for AccountDeletionPipe {
///     async fn run(
///         &mut self,
///         account_deletion: AccountDeletion,
///         metrics: Arc<MetricsCollection>,
///     ) -> CarbonResult<()> {
///         // Custom processing logic for the deletion event
///         Ok(())
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// - `account_deletion`: An `AccountDeletion` instance representing the account
///   deletion event.
/// - `metrics`: A vector of `Metrics` objects for monitoring and reporting
///   purposes.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// Returns a `CarbonResult<()>`, which will be `Ok(())` if processing is
/// successful, or an error if there was an issue with the processing logic.
///
/// # Notes
///
/// - This trait is asynchronous and requires the `async_trait` crate for
///   `async` methods.
/// - Ensure that `AccountDeletionPipe` is configured with a processor capable
///   of handling account deletions, as this is its primary responsibility
///   within the pipeline.
